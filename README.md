# 🎧 Lyrics-Based Music Recommendation System

An intelligent, content-based music recommender system that delivers **personalized song suggestions** by analyzing **lyrics** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, this lightweight web app showcases strong skills in machine learning, text vectorization, and user-friendly interface design — perfect for music lovers and a standout portfolio project for AI/ML roles.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 🔍 **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**: Finds lyrically similar tracks using NLP.
- 💬 **Lyrics-Centric Discovery**: Goes beyond genre or artist — recommends based on lyrical themes.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Recommendations**: Interactive, fast, and intuitive web app using **Streamlit**.
- 🧠 **Explainable ML**: Transparent, interpretable results powered by classical machine learning.

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Loads a curated dataset of songs with their lyrics.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes lyrics using **NLTK**.
3. **Vectorization**: Converts lyrics into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.
4. **Similarity Matching**: Computes **cosine similarity** to identify closest matches.
5. **Recommendation Output**: Returns top similar songs instantly based on the selected track.
